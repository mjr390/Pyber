# Pyber Ride Sharing

# Analysis
    1. From the scatter plot we can conclude that the higher the number of drivers there are in a city type, the less the average fare will be in that city type.
    2. The Total Rides by City Type shows that Urban is the city type with the most rides (68.4%), followed by Suburban(26.3%) and Rural having the lowest share of rides (5.3%)
    3. The scatter plot shows that the number of rides for each city type clusters around a different area:
        Urban clusters around the 20 to 30 rides, Suburban around the 15 to 20 rides and Rural around 5 to 10 rides.
